'Due to the high latitude, golden hour can last much longer during certain seasons, especially in summer.' : isNearEquator ? 'Being close to the equator, golden hour is relatively consistent year-round but shorter in duration.' : 'The timing varies throughout the year, with longer golden hours in winter and shorter ones in summer.'} Consider the local timezone (${timezone}) when planning your shoots.`,
