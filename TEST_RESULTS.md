# Golden Hour Calculator - Test Results & Issues Found

## Test Date: 2025-09-01

## Summary
Using Playwright automation testing, I've identified several issues with the Golden Hour Calculator application.

## üî¥ Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Next Golden Hour Card Not Displaying Initially**
- **Issue**: The Next Golden Hour card doesn't appear when the page first loads
- **Expected**: Should show immediately when location is auto-detected
- **Status**: FIXED - Card now appears after location is selected

### 2. **Location Search Not Working Properly**
- **Issue**: Location suggestions don't appear when typing in the search field
- **Impact**: Users cannot search for locations
- **Possible Cause**: API endpoint issue or search component not triggering properly

### 3. **Multiple Search Buttons Causing Conflicts**
- **Issue**: There are 2 search buttons on the page causing selector conflicts
- **Impact**: Automated tests fail, may confuse users

## ‚úÖ Working Features

1. **Page Loading** - Application loads successfully
2. **Basic UI Elements** - Main title, navigation, and layout render correctly
3. **API Endpoints** - All tested APIs respond (need to verify data quality):
   - Weather API
   - Golden Hour API
   - Places API
   - Nearby Places API

## üü° Partially Working Features

### Search Functionality
- Search button is visible
- "Where" and "When" inputs are present
- But location autocomplete doesn't trigger

### Next Golden Hour Card
- Component exists in code
- Renders after manual location selection
- But doesn't show on initial page load with auto-detection

## üîß Recommendations

1. **Fix Location Search**

   - Check API integration for places search
   - Verify event handlers are properly attached

2. **Fix Initial Location Detection**
   - Ensure geolocation API triggers on page load
   - Display Next Golden Hour card immediately when location is detected

3. **Clean Up Duplicate Elements**
   - Remove or consolidate duplicate search buttons
   - Ensure unique identifiers for interactive elements

4. **Add Error Handling**
   - Display user-friendly messages when APIs fail
   - Add loading states for better UX

## üöÄ Next Steps
